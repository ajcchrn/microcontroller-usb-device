# Microcontroller USB-device 

This repository contains a programming project for the class [DVGB06](https://www.kau.se/en/education/programmes-and-courses/courses/DVGB06) at [KAU](https://www.kau.se/).

The goal of the programming project is to write a small supporting library for making generic USB-devices based on an AVR or SAMD21 based microcontroller.
